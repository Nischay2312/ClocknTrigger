<msg type="warning" file="ConstraintSystem" num="0" >The Offset constraint &lt;OFFSET = IN 8ns BEFORE &quot;fastclk&quot;;&gt; [ClocknTrigger.ucf(34)], is specified without a duration.  This will result in a lack of hold time checks in timing reports.  If hold time checks are desired a duration value should be specified following the &apos;VALID&apos; keyword.
