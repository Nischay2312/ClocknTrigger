<tr><td>[Warning]:Cpld - Unable to retrieve the path to the iSE Project Repository. Will   use the default filename of 'ClocknTrigger.ise'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>[Warning]:Cpld - Clock 'fastclk' is used in an OFFSET timespec, this clock should   be explicitly declared as a global clock input (BUFG) in your design in order   for the OFFSET timespec to be properly analyzed. This software may attempt to   place this signal on a pin that can drive a BUFG if it does not already have   a pin assigned, however if the LOC constraint is not specified by the user   then the OFFSET timespec will not be applied. OFFSET constraints on clocks   that do not drive a BUFG will be ignored. In this case a FROM:TO constraint   should be used instead.</td></tr>
